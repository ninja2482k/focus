## 🧰 Technologies Used

| Tool / Language | Purpose                     |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| HTML5           | Page structure               |
| CSS3            | Styling and responsive layout|
| JavaScript (ES6)| Timer, XP, and UI logic      |
| LocalStorage    | Saving user data             |

## 🧠 How the Code Works

1. `dashboard.html` loads the main interface.
2. `script.js` initializes the timer, sets event listeners, and controls UI state.
3. XP is awarded upon completing sessions and saved using `localStorage`.
4. Heatmap is updated daily based on session completions.
5. `settings.html` lets the user configure their productivity preferences.
